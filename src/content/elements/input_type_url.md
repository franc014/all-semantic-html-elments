element: "input type=url"
description: "This input allows a user to enter and edit a url. The input value is automatically validated to ensure that it's either empty or a properly-formatted URL before the form can be submitted. The :valid and :invalid CSS pseudo-classes are automatically applied as appropriate to visually denote whether the current value of the field is a valid URL or not."
